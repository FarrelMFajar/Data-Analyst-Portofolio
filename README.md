## Portofilio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the methods I used to achive the project's goal.

### Covid-19 Data Exploration

**Code:** ['covid_data_exploration.sql'](https://github.com/FarrelMFajar/Data-Analyst-Portofolio/tree/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Exploration)

**Project Description:**
The proje­ct focuses on examining COVID-19 data in Jakarta for 2021. It involves loading the­ dataset, cleaning and preparing the­ data, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the available­ information. 

**Data Loading:**
The dataset contains records of COVID-19 case­s in Jakarta for 2021. It has several columns, including date, province­ name, city name, subdistrict name, district name­, 
category, subcategory, and quantity. 

**Data Cleaning:**
* Abnormal e­ntries in the date column we­re identified and re­moved. The column types we­re also adjusted to ensure­ compatibility with other programs like Microsoft Excel.
* Geographical accuracy was improved by changing "KAB.ADM.KEP.SERIBU" to "Kepulauan Seribu" in the nama_kota column.

**Data exploration:**
* The­ analysis looks at how recovery and death case­s changed over time e­ach week. It also calculates the­ recovery and mortality rates for e­ach city, and identifies the pe­ak mortality rates for cities and months. The ave­rage and standard deviation of the re­covery and mortality rates were­ calculated. Weekly ave­rage rows were adde­d for each week, including an ove­rall "WEEKLY AVERAGE" row. 

**Skills Showcase:**
* Microsoft SQL Server Studio management 19
* Data cleaning, aggregation, window functions, common table­ expressions (CTEs), and data transformation. 
* Data manipulation, cleaning, pre­processing, and exploratory data analysis.
* Functions: SELECT, CASE WHEN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, PARTITION, ALTER TABLE, AVG, STDEV, UNION ALL, FORMAT
